= Lab4 - Breaking the monolith apart - II
:experimental:

In the previous lab, you learned how to take an existing monolithic app and refactor a single _inventory_ service using Quarkus.
The previous lab resulted in you creating an inventory service, but so far we haven’t started _strangling_ the monolith. That is
because the inventory service is never called directly by the UI. It’s a backend service that is only used only by other backend
services. In this lab, you will create the catalog service and the catalog service will call the inventory service. When you are
ready, you will change the route to tie the UI calls to new service.

To implement this, we are going to use https://access.redhat.com/products/spring-boot[Red Hat support for Spring Boot^]. The reason for using Spring for this service is to introduce you to
Spring Boot development, and how https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^] helps to make Spring
development on Kubernetes easy. In real life, the reason for choosing Spring Boot vs. others mostly depends on personal preferences,
like existing knowledge, etc. At the core Spring and Java EE are very similar.

The goal is to produce something like:

image::catalog-goal.png[Greeting, 700]

=== What is Spring Framework?

Spring is one of the most popular Java Frameworks and offers an alternative to the Java EE programming model. Spring is also very
popular for building applications based on microservices architectures. Spring Boot is a popular tool in the Spring ecosystem that
helps with organizing and using 3rd-party libraries together with Spring and also provides a mechanism for boot strapping
embeddable runtimes, like Apache Tomcat. Bootable applications (sometimes also called _fat jars_) fits the container model very
well since in a container platform like OpenShift responsibilities like starting, stopping and monitoring applications are then
handled by the container platform instead of an Application Server.

*Red Hat& offers support and maintenance over stated time periods for the major versions of _Spring Boot_. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_support_for_spring_boot[Learn more^].

=== Aggregate microservices calls

Another thing you will learn in this lab is one of the techniques to aggregate services using service-to-service calls. Other
possible solutions would be to use a microservices gateway or combine services using client-side logic.

==== 1. Setup a Catalog project

Run the following commands to set up your environment for this lab and start in the right directory:

In the project explorer, expand the _catalog_ project (ignore the red error icons on some files - we'll get to those shortly)

image::catalog-project.png[catalog-setup, 700]

==== 2. Examine the Maven project structure

The sample project shows the components of a basic Spring Boot project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven
best practices.

As you can see, there are some files that we have prepared for you in the project. Under _src/main/resources/static/index.html_ we
have for example prepared a simple html-based UI file for you. This matches very well what you would get if you generated an empty
project from the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr^] web page.

One file that differs slightly is the `pom.xml`. Please open the and examine it a bit closer (but do not change anything at this
time)

As you review the content, you will notice that there are a lot of _TODO_ comments. *Do not remove them!* These comments are used
as a marker and without them, you will not be able to finish this lab.

Notice that we are not using the default BOM (Bill of material) that Spring Boot projects typically use. Instead, we are using a
BOM provided by Red Hat as part of the http://snowdrop.me/[Snowdrop^] project.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.snowdrop</groupId>
    <artifactId>snowdrop-dependencies</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.6.Final-redhat-00001</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    <scope>import</scope>
</dependency>
----

We use this bill of material to make sure that we are using the version of for example Apache Tomcat that Red Hat supports.

==== 3. Add web (Apache Tomcat) to the application

Our application will be a web application, so we need to use a servlet container like Apache Tomcat or Undertow. Since Red Hat
offers support for Apache Tomcat (e.g., security patches, bug fixes, etc.), we will use it.

[NOTE]
====
Undertow is another an open source project that is maintained by Red Hat and therefore Red Hat plans to add support for
Undertow shortly.
====

Because of the Red Hat BOM and access to the Red Hat maven repositories all we need to do to enable the supported Apache Tomcat as
servlet container is to add the following dependency to your _pom.xml_. Add these lines at the
`<!-- TODO: Add web (tomcat) dependency here -->` marker:

[source,xml, role="copypaste"]
----
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
        </dependency>
----

We will also make use of Java Persistence API (JPA) so we need to add the following to _pom.xml_ at the
`<!-- TODO: Add jdbc dependency here -->` marker:

[source,xml, role="copypaste"]
----
        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc</artifactId>
        </dependency>
----

We will go ahead and add a bunch of other dependencies while we have the pom.xml open. These will be explained later. Add these at
the `<!-- TODO: Add actuator, feign and hystrix dependency here -->` marker:

[source,xml, role="copypaste"]
----
       <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
          <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
          <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-hystrix</artifactId>
        </dependency>
----

This should also make the red error icons disappear! Now, build the project to make sure everything compiles so far:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog clean package
----

If it builds successfully (you will see *BUILD SUCCESS*), you have now successfully executed the first step in this lab.

Now you’ve seen how to get started with Spring Boot development on Red Hat Runtimes.

In next step of this lab, we will add the logic to be able to read data from the database.

==== 4. Create Domain Objects

We are now ready to implement the database repository.

In the catalog project, right-click on the `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service` directory and select **New File**. Name the file `ProductRepository.java`:

image::newfile.png[catalog-setup, 700]

image::newfile-name.png[catalog-setup, 600]

In the file, add this code:

[source,java, role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.List;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.RowMapper;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public class ProductRepository {

    //TODO: Autowire the jdbcTemplate here

    //TODO: Add row mapper here

    //TODO: Create a method for returning all products

    //TODO: Create a method for returning one product

}
----

[NOTE]
====
This class is annotated with `@Repository`. This is a feature of Spring that makes it possible to avoid a lot of boiler
plate code and only write the implementation details for this data repository. It also makes it very easy to switch to another
data storage, like a NoSQL database.
====

Spring Data provides a convenient way for us to access data without having to write a lot of boiler plate code. One way to do that
is to use a _JdbcTemplate_. First we need to autowire that as a member to _ProductRepository_. Add these at the
`TODO: Autowire the jdbcTemplate here` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;
----

The _JdbcTemplate_ require that we provide a _RowMapper_ so that it can map between rows in the query to Java Objects. We are
going to define the _RowMapper_ like this. Add these at the `<!-- TODO: Add row mapper here -->` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    private RowMapper<Product> rowMapper = (rs, rowNum) -> new Product(
            rs.getString("itemId"),
            rs.getString("name"),
            rs.getString("description"),
            rs.getDouble("price"));
----

Now we are ready to create the business methods. Let’s start with the `readAll()`. It should return a
`List<Product>` and then we can write the query as `SELECT * FROM catalog` and use the rowMapper to map that into `Product`
objects. Add these at the `<!-- TODO: Create a method for returning all products -->` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    public List<Product> readAll() {
        return this.jdbcTemplate.query("SELECT * FROM catalog", rowMapper);
    }
----

We also need a way to find a single product element. Add these at the
`<!-- TODO: Create a method for returning one product -->` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    public Product findById(String id) {
        return this.jdbcTemplate.queryForObject("SELECT * FROM catalog WHERE itemId = ?", new Object[]{id}, rowMapper);
    }
----

The _ProductRepository_ should now have all the components, but we still need to tell spring how to connect to the database. For
local development we will use the H2 in-memory database. Later, when deploying this to OpenShift we will use the
PostgreSQL database, which matches what we are using in production.

The Spring Framework has a lot of sane defaults that can always seem magical sometimes, but basically all we have to do to setup
the database driver is to provide some configuration values. Open `src/main/resources/application-default.properties` and add the
following properties where the comment says `#TODO: Add database properties`.

[source, properties, role="copypaste"]
----
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:catalog;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=sa
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.h2.Driver
----

The Spring Data framework will automatically see if there is a `schema.sql` in the class path and run that when initializing.

Now you’ve seen how to use Spring Data to collect data from the database and how to use a local H2 database for development and
testing.

In next step of this lab, we will add the logic to expose the database content from REST endpoints using JSON format.

==== 5. Create Catalog Service

Now you are going to create a service class. Later on the service class will be the one that controls the interaction with the
inventory service, but for now it’s basically just a wrapper of the repository class.

Again, create a new class `CatalogService.java` in the `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service` package.

Replace the empty class with this code:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

//import com.redhat.coolstore.client.InventoryClient;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;

import org.json.JSONArray;
import org.json.JSONObject;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class CatalogService {

    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository repository;

    //TODO: Autowire Inventory Client

    public Product read(String id) {
        Product product = repository.findById(id);
        //TODO: Update the quantity for the product by calling the Inventory service
        return product;
    }

    public List<Product> readAll() {
        List<Product> productList = repository.readAll();
        //TODO: Update the quantity for the products by calling the Inventory service
        return productList;
    }

}
----

As you can see there are a number of `TODO` in the code, and later we will use these placeholders to add logic for calling the
Inventory Client to get the quantity.

Now we are ready to create the endpoints that will expose REST service.

Start by creating a new class called `CatalogEndpoint.java` in the `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service` package.

Replace the contents with this code:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.List;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/services")
public class CatalogEndpoint {

    private final CatalogService catalogService;

    public CatalogEndpoint(CatalogService catalogService) {
      this.catalogService = catalogService;
    }

    @GetMapping("/products")
    public List<Product> readAll() {
      return this.catalogService.readAll();
    }

    @GetMapping("/product/{id}")
    public Product read(@PathVariable("id") String id) {
      return this.catalogService.read(id);
    }

}
----

The Spring MVC Framework by default uses _Jackson_ to serialize or map Java objects to JSON and vice-versa.  Jackson extends
upon JAX-B and can automatically parse simple Java structures and parse them into JSON and vice versa. Our
`Product.java` pre-created class is very simple and only contains basic attributes we do not need to tell Jackson how to parse between Product and
JSON.

Since we now have endpoints that return the catalog we can also start the service and load the default page again, which should
now return the products.

Start the application via the CodeReady Workspaces Terminal using the following command:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean spring-boot:run -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog
----

[NOTE]
====
If you get a popup about port `8081` being available, simply dismiss it with the `X` button.
====

Wait for the application to start and get the `Started RestApplication in 4.025 seconds (JVM running for 4.361)` log message. Then, verify the endpoint by running the following command in a separate Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/services/products | jq
----

You should get a full JSON array consisting of all the products:

[source,json]
----
  {
    "itemId": "329299",
    "name": "Red Fedora",
    "desc": "Official Red Hat Fedora",
    "price": 34.99,
    "quantity": 0
  },
  { ... }
----

You have now successfully executed the third step in this lab.

Now you’ve seen how to create a REST application in Spring MVC and create a simple application that returns product.

In the next step, we will also call another service to enrich the endpoint response with inventory status.

[WARNING]
====
Make sure to stop the service by clicking kbd:[CTRL-C] in the terminal that the app is running in!
====

==== 6. Get inventory data

When redesigning our application to Microservices using domain driven design we have identified that Inventory and Product Catalog
are two separate domains. However our current UI expects to retrieve data from both the Catalog Service and Inventory service in a
singe request.

===== Service interaction

Our problem is that the user interface requires data from two services when calling the REST service on `/services/products`.
There are multiple ways to solve this like:

*1. Client Side integration* - We could extend our UI to first call `/services/products` and then for each product item call
`/services/inventory/{prodId}` to get the inventory status and then combine the result in the web browser. This would be the
least intrusive method, but it also means that if we have 100 of products the client will make 101 requests to the server. If we
have a slow internet connection this may cause issues.

*2. Microservices Gateway* - Creating a gateway in front of the _Catalog Service_ that first calls the Catalog Service and then
based on the response calls the inventory is another option. This way we can avoid lots of calls from the client to the server.
http://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel^] provides nice capabilities to do this and if you are interested to learn
more about this, please checkout the Coolstore Microservices example:
http://github.com/jbossdemocentral/coolstore-microservice[Here^]

*3. Service-to-Service* - Depending on use-case and preferences another solution would be to do service-to-service calls
instead. In our case means that the Catalog Service would call the Inventory service using REST to retrieve the inventory status
and include that in the response.

There are no right or wrong answers here, but since this is a workshop on application modernization using Red Hat Runtimes we will
not choose option 1 or 2 here. Instead we are going to use option 3 and extend our Catalog to call the Inventory service.

==== 7. Implementing the Inventory Client

We can now create the client that calls the Inventory.
Netflix has provided some nice extensions to the Spring Framework that are mostly captured in the Spring Cloud project, however
Spring Cloud is mainly focused on Pivotal Cloud Foundry and because of that Red Hat and others have contributed Spring Cloud
Kubernetes to the Spring Cloud project, which enables the same functionallity for Kubernetes based platforms like OpenShift.

The inventory client will use a Netflix project called _Feign_, which provides a nice way to avoid having to write boilerplate
code. Feign also integrates with Hystrix which gives us the capability to Circuit Break calls that don’t work. We will discuss this
more later, but let’s start with the implementation of the Inventory Client. Using Feign all we have to do is create a interface
that details which parameters and return type we expect, annotate it with `@RequestMapping` and provide some details and then
annotate the interface with `@Feign` and provide it with a name.

Create the `InventoryClient.java` class in the `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/client/` package in the project explorer.

Add the following code to the file:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.client;

import feign.hystrix.FallbackFactory;
import org.springframework.cloud.openfeign.FeignClient;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMethod;

@FeignClient(name = "inventory", url = "${inventory.url}")
public interface InventoryClient {

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/services/inventory/{itemId}", consumes = {MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE})
    String getInventoryStatus(@PathVariable("itemId") String itemId);

    //TODO: Add Fallback factory here

}
----

Open the `src/main/resources/application-default.properties` file. Add these properties to it at the `#TODO: Configure netflix libraries` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
inventory.url=inventory.{{ USER_ID }}-inventory.svc.cluster.local:8080
feign.hystrix.enabled=true
----

By setting `inventory.url` we are hard coding the actual URL of the service to `{{ USER_ID }}-inventory.svc.cluster.local:8080` (which will point to our inventory microservice we created in the last lab). Using Kubernetes there is no need to have multiple endpoints
listed here since Kubernetes has a concept of _Services_ that will internally route between multiple instances of the same
service.

Now that we have a client we can make use of it in our _CatalogService_.

Open _src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/CatalogService.java_

And autowire (e.g. inject) the client into it by inserting this at the `//TODO: Autowire Inventory Client` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Autowired
    private InventoryClient inventoryClient;
----

Next, update the `read(String id)` method at the comment
`//TODO: Update the quantity for the product by calling the Inventory service` add the following:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
        JSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(inventoryClient.getInventoryStatus(product.getItemId()));
        List<String> quantity = IntStream.range(0, jsonArray.length())
            .mapToObj(index -> ((JSONObject)jsonArray.get(index))
            .optString("quantity")).collect(Collectors.toList());
        product.setQuantity(Integer.parseInt(quantity.get(0)));
----

Also, don’t forget to add the import statement by un-commenting the import statement for InventoryClient near the top

[source, java]
----
import com.redhat.coolstore.client.InventoryClient;
----

Also in the _readAll()_ method replace the comment
`//TODO: Update the quantity for the products by calling the Inventory service` with the following:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
        productList.forEach(p -> {
          JSONArray jsonArray = new JSONArray(this.inventoryClient.getInventoryStatus(p.getItemId()));
          List<String> quantity = IntStream.range(0, jsonArray.length())
            .mapToObj(index -> ((JSONObject)jsonArray.get(index))
            .optString("quantity")).collect(Collectors.toList());
          p.setQuantity(Integer.parseInt(quantity.get(0)));
        });
----

[NOTE]
====
Class `JSONArray` is an ordered sequence of values. Its external text form is a string wrapped in square brackets with
commas separating the values. The internal form is an object having get and opt methods for accessing the values by index, and
element methods for adding or replacing values.
====

==== 8. Create a fallback for inventory

In the previous step we added a client to call the Inventory service. Services calling services is a common practice in
Microservices Architecture, but as we add more and more services the likelihood of a problem increases dramatically. Even if each
service has 99.9% update, if we have 100 of services our estimated up time will only be ~90%. We therefore need to plan for
failures to happen and our application logic has to consider that dependent services are not responding.

In the previous step we used the Feign client from the Netflix cloud native libraries to avoid having to write boilerplate code
for doing a REST call. However Feign also have another good property which is that we easily create fallback logic. In this case
we will use static inner class since we want the logic for the fallback to be part of the Client and not in a separate class.

In the `InventoryClient`, add the following code at the `//TODO: Add Fallback factory here` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
    @Component
    class InventoryClientFallbackFactory implements FallbackFactory<InventoryClient> {
      @Override
      public InventoryClient create(Throwable cause) {
        return itemId -> "[{'quantity':-1}]";
      }
    }
----

After creating the fallback factory all we have todo is to tell Feign to use that fallback in case of an issue, by adding the
fallbackFactory property to the `@FeignClient` annotation. and replace the existing `@FeignClient(name = "inventory", url = "${inventory.url}")` line with
this line:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
@FeignClient(name = "inventory", url = "${inventory.url}", fallbackFactory = InventoryClient.InventoryClientFallbackFactory.class)
----

=== 9. Slow running services


Having fallbacks is good but that also requires that we can correctly detect when a dependent services isn’t responding correctly.
Besides from not responding a service can also respond slowly causing our services to also respond slow. This can lead to
cascading issues that are hard to debug and pinpoint issues with. We should therefore also have sane defaults for our services. You
can add defaults by adding them to the configuration.

Open `src/main/resources/application-default.properties`

And add this line to it at the `#TODO: Set timeout to for inventory` marker:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=20000
----

Let's re-test our app locally. Re-build and re-run the app:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean spring-boot:run -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog
----

Then, access the product catalog again in a separate terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/services/products | jq
----

You will see something like:

[source,json]
----
  {
    "itemId": "444437",
    "name": "Lytro Camera",
    "desc": "Consumers who want to up their photography game are looking at newfangled cameras like the Lytro Field camera, designed to take photos with infinite focus, so you can decide later exactly where you want the focus of each image to be.",
    "price": 44.3,
    "quantity": 230
  }
----

Notice the `"quantity": 230` - because CodeReady Workspaces runs in our OpenShift cluster, our value for `inventory.url` we set earlier is completely valid!

Congratulations! You now have the framework for retrieving products from the product catalog and enriching the data with
inventory data from an external service. In next step of this lab we will deploy our application to OpenShift Container Platform
and then start adding additional features to take care of various aspects of cloud native microservice development.

==== 10. Add Database OpenShift

Our production catalog microservice will use an external database (PostgreSQL) to house inventory data. We've created an `{{ USER_ID}}-catalog` project for you. Visit the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-catalog[Topology View for {{ USER_ID }}-catalog project^].

Click **+Add** on the left, on the _Database_ box on the project overview:

image::db-catalog.png[db, 700]

Type in `postgres` in the search box, and click on the *PostgreSQL (ephemeral)*:

image::db-catalog-postgres.png[db, 700]

Click on *Instantiate Template* and fill in the following fields, leaving the others as their default values:

* **Namespace**: _choose `{{ USER_ID }}-catalog` for the first Namespace. Leave the second one as `openshift`_
* **Database Service Name**: `catalog-database`
* **PostgreSQL Connection Username**: `catalog`
* **PostgreSQL Connection Password**: `mysecretpassword`
* **PostgreSQL Database Name**: `catalog`

image::db-catalog-postgres-fields.png[db, 700]

This will deploy the database to our catalog project. Click on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-catalog[Topology View^] to see it:

==== 11. Add production configuration

Create a new file in the `src/main/resources` called `application-openshift.properties` in CodeReady Workspaces.

[WARNING]
====
Be sure your new file is in the same directory alongside the existing `application-default.properties`!
====

Add the following content to this file:

[source, properties, role="copypaste"]
----
# Production
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://catalog-database:5432/catalog
spring.datasource.username=catalog
spring.datasource.password=mysecretpassword
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=always
spring.datasource.initialize=true
spring.datasource.schema=classpath:/schema.sql
spring.datasource.continue-on-error=true

feign.hystrix.enabled=true
hystrix.command.default.execution.isolation.thread.timeoutInMilliseconds=20000
inventory.url=inventory.{{ USER_ID }}-inventory.svc.cluster.local:8080
----

We'll use this file by specifying a Spring _profile_ when we deploy to OpenShift.

==== 12. Build and Deploy

If you still have the local app running, stop it by typing kbd:[CTRL-C] in its Terminal.

Build and deploy the project using the following command in a Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean install spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog
----

You should see a *BUILD SUCCESS* at the end of the build
output.

Then deploy the project using the following command in the CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{ USER_ID }}-catalog && \
oc new-build registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11 --binary --name=catalog-springboot -l app=catalog-springboot
----

And then start and watch the build, which will take about a minute to complete:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc start-build catalog-springboot --from-file $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog/target/catalog-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --follow
----

Once the build is done, we’ll deploy it as an OpenShift application and override the spring profile to use our _production_ values.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc new-app catalog-springboot --as-deployment-config -e JAVA_OPTS_APPEND='-Dspring.profiles.active=openshift' 
----

and run this to expose your service to the world and add a health check:

Finally, make sure it’s actually done rolling out. Visit the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-catalog[Topology View^] for the catalog, and ensure you get the blue circles!

And then access the http://catalog-springboot-{{ USER_ID }}-catalog.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Catalog Web frontend^] and ensure you get the expected inventory quantity (and not `-1`):

*Congratulations!* You have deployed the Catalog service as a microservice which in turn calls into the Inventory service to
retrieve inventory data.

==== 13. Strangling the monolith

So far we haven’t started https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html[strangling the monolith^]. Each external request
coming into OpenShift (unless using ingress, which we are not) will pass through a route. In our monolith the web page uses client
side REST calls to load different parts of pages.

For the home page the product list is loaded via a REST call to `/services/products`. At the moment calls to that URL will
still hit product catalog in the monolith. Now we will route these calls to our newly created catalog services instead and end up
with something like:

image::catalog-goal.png[Greeting, 700]

Follow the steps below to create a *Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)* based route. CORS is a mechanism that allows restricted
resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

Quarkus comes with a _CORS filter_ which implements the _javax.servlet.Filter_ interface and intercepts all incoming HTTP requests. It can be enabled in the Quarkus configuration file. Add the following line in the `inventory` project (our Quarkus app created earlier) in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file:

[source, properties, role="copypaste"]
----
%prod.quarkus.http.cors=true
----

Rebuild and redeploy the *inventory* application using this command (which will again use the OpenShift Quarkus extension to deploy):

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{USER_ID}}-inventory && \
mvn clean package -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/inventory -DskipTests
----

This will take about a minute to complete. Once the build is done, the inventory pod will be deployed automatically via DeploymentConfig Trigger in OpenShift.

Open `CatalogEndpoint` class in `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service` of `catalog` project to allow restricted resources on
a _product_ page of the monolith application. Replace the class-level annotations with:

[source, java, role="copypaste"]
----
@CrossOrigin
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/services")
----

We simply added the `@CrossOrigin` annotation.

Rebuild and re-deploy the *catalog* service using the following commands:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean install spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog && \
oc start-build -n {{ USER_ID }}-catalog catalog-springboot --from-file $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/catalog/target/catalog-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --follow
----

This will take about a minute to complete. Once the build is done, the catalog pod will be deployed automatically via DeploymentConfig Trigger in OpenShift.

Let’s update the catalog endpoint in monolith application. In the *monolith* project, open `catalog.js` in `src/main/webapp/app/services` and add a line as shown in the image to define the value of `baseUrl`, just before the `factory.getProducts = function()` line:

[source,javascript,role="copypaste"]
----
baseUrl='http://catalog-springboot-{{ USER_ID }}-catalog.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}/services/products';
----

image::catalog_js_strangler.png[strangler, 700]

Rebuild and re-deploy the *monolith* project in CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn clean package -DskipTests -Popenshift -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/monolith && \
oc start-build -n {{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-dev coolstore --from-file $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/monolith/deployments/ROOT.war --follow
----

Once the build is done, the coolstore pod will be deployed automatically via DeploymentConfig Trigger in OpenShift. Ensure it’s
rolled out by visiting the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-coolstore-dev[Monolith Topology^] and wait for the blue circles!

==== 14. Test the UI

Open the monolith UI by clicking the route URL icon (the arrow to the upper right of the blue circle for the coolstore monolith)

Observe that the new catalog is being used along with the monolith:

image::coolstore_web.png[Greeting, 700]

The screen will look the same, with proper inventory, but notice that the earlier product _Women RHEL 8 t-shirt_ is now gone, as it has been removed in
our new catalog microservice.

[NOTE]
====
If the web page is still same then you should clean cookies and caches in your web browser.
====

==== Congratulations!

You have now successfully begun to _strangle_ the monolith. Part of the monolith’s functionality (Inventory
and Catalog) are now implemented as microservices.

==== Summary

In this lab you learned a bit more about developing with Spring Boot and how it can be used together with OpenShift.

You created a new product catalog microservice representing functionality previously implemented in the monolithic CoolStore
application. This new service also communicates with the inventory service to retrieve the inventory status for each product.
