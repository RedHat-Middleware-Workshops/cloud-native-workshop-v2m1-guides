= Lab3 - Breaking the monolith apart - I
:experimental:

In the previous labs you learned how to take an existing monolithic Java EE application to the cloud with JBoss EAP and OpenShift, and you got a glimpse into the power of OpenShift for existing applications.

You will now begin the process of modernizing the application by breaking the application into multiple microservices using different technologies, with the eventual goal of re-architecting the entire application as a set of distributed microservices. Later on we’ll explore how you can better manage and monitor the application after it is re-architected.

In this lab you will learn more about _Supersonic, Subatomic Java_ with https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus^], which is designed to be container and developer friendly.

Quarkus is a _Kubernetes Native_ Java stack, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards. Amazingly fast boot time, incredibly low RSS memory (not just heap size!) offering near instant scale up and high density memory utilization in container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. Quarkus uses a technique called compile time boot.

*Red Hat* offers the fully supported https://access.redhat.com/products/quarkus[Red Hat Build of Quarkus(RHBQ)^] with support and maintenance of Quarkus. In this workhop, you will use Quarkus to develop Kubernetes-native microservices and deploy them to OpenShift. Quarkus is one of the runtimes included in https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes^]. https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_build_of_quarkus[Learn more about RHBQ^].

=== Goals of this lab

You will implement one component of the monolith as a Quarkus microservice and modify it to address microservice concerns, understand its structure, deploy it to OpenShift and exercise the interfaces between Quarkus apps, microservices, and OpenShift/Kubernetes.

The goal is to deploy this new microservice alongside the existing monolith, and then later on we’ll tie them together. But after this lab, you should end up with something like:

image::goal.png[lab3_goal, 700]

==== 1. Setup an Inventory proejct

Run the following commands to set up your environment for this lab and start in the right directory:

In the project explorer, expand the *inventory* project.

image::codeready-workspace-inventory-project.png[inventory_setup, 700]

==== 2. Examine the Maven project structure

The sample Quarkus project shows a minimal CRUD service exposing a couple of endpoints over REST, with a front-end based on Angular so you can play with it from your browser.

While the code is surprisingly simple, under the hood this is using:

* RESTEasy to expose the REST endpoints
* Hibernate ORM with Panache to perform CRUD operations on the database
* A PostgreSQL database; see below to run one via Linux Container
* Some example `Dockerfile`s to generate new images for JVM and Native mode compilation

`Hibernate ORM` is the de facto JPA implementation and offers you the full breadth of an Object Relational Mapper. It makes complex mappings possible, but it does not make simple and common mappings trivial. Hibernate ORM with Panache focuses on making your entities trivial and fun to write in Quarkus.

Now let’s write some code and create a domain model, service interface and a RESTful endpoint to access inventory:

image::inventory-arch.png[Inventory RESTful Service, 700]

==== 3. Add Quarkus Extensions

We will add Quarkus extensions to the Inventory application for using _Panache_ (a simplified way to access data via Hibernate ORM), a database with Postgres (in production) and _H2_ (in-memory database for testing). We'll also add the ability to add health probes (which we'll use later on) using the MicroProfile Health extension. Run the following commands to add the extensions using CodeReady Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn -q quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="hibernate-orm-panache, jdbc-h2, smallrye-health" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/inventory
----

you will see:

[source,sh]
----
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache has been installed
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-health has been installed
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-h2 has been installed
----

This adds the extensions to `pom.xml`.

[NOTE]
====
There are many https://quarkus.io/extensions/[more extensions^] for Quarkus for popular frameworks like https://vertx.io/[Vert.x^], http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel^], http://infinispan.org/[Infinispan^], Spring (e.g. `@Autowired`), and more.
====

==== 4. Create Inventory Entity

With our skeleton project in place, let’s get to work defining the business logic.

The first step is to define the model (entity) of an Inventory object. Since Quarkus uses Hibernate ORM Panache, we can re-use the
same model definition from our monolithic application - no need to re-write or re-architect!

Under the `inventory` directory, open up the empty *Inventory.java* file in _com.redhat.coolstore_ package and paste the following code into it (identical to the
monolith code):

[source,java, role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore;

import javax.persistence.Cacheable;
import javax.persistence.Entity;

import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheEntity;

@Entity
@Cacheable
public class Inventory extends PanacheEntity {

    public String itemId;
    public String location;
    public int quantity;
    public String link;

    public Inventory() {

    }

}
----

By extending `PanacheEntity` in your entities, you will get an ID field that is auto-generated. If you require a custom ID
strategy, you can extend `PanacheEntityBase` instead and handle the ID yourself.

By using Use public fields, there is no need for functionless getters and setters (those that simply get or set the field). You
simply refer to fields like Inventory.location without the need to write a Inventory.getLocation() implementation. Panache will
auto-generate any getters and setters you do not write, or you can develop your own getters/setters that do more than get/set,
which will be called when the field is accessed directly.

The `PanacheEntity` superclass comes with lots of super useful static methods and you can add your own in your derived entity
class. Much like traditional object-oriented programming it’s natural and recommended to place custom queries as close to the
entity as possible, ideally within the entity definition itself. Users can just start using your entity Inventory by typing
Inventory, and get completion for all the operations in a single place.

When an entity is annotated with `@Cacheable`, all its field values are cached except for collections and relations to other
entities. This means the entity can be loaded quicker without querying the database for frequently-accessed, but rarely-changing
data.

==== 5. Define the RESTful endpoint of Inventory

In this step we will mirror the abstraction of a _service_ so that we can inject the Inventory _service_ into various places (like
a RESTful resource endpoint) in the future. This is the same approach that our monolith uses, so we can re-use this idea again.
Open up the empty *InventoryResource.java* class in the _com.redhat.coolstore_ package.

Add this code to it:

[source,java, role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.json.Json;
import javax.ws.rs.Consumes;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Response;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper;
import javax.ws.rs.ext.Provider;

import org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.jaxrs.PathParam;

@Path("/services/inventory")
@ApplicationScoped
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class InventoryResource {

    @GET
    public List<Inventory> getAll() {
        return Inventory.listAll();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{itemId}")
    public List<Inventory> getAvailability(@PathParam String itemId) {
        return Inventory.<Inventory>streamAll()
        .filter(p -> p.itemId.equals(itemId))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    @Provider
    public static class ErrorMapper implements ExceptionMapper<Exception> {

        @Override
        public Response toResponse(Exception exception) {
            int code = 500;
            if (exception instanceof WebApplicationException) {
                code = ((WebApplicationException) exception).getResponse().getStatus();
            }
            return Response.status(code)
                    .entity(Json.createObjectBuilder().add("error", exception.getMessage()).add("code", code).build())
                    .build();
        }

    }
}
----

The above REST services defines two endpoints:

* `/services/inventory` that is accessible via _HTTP GET_ which will return all known product Inventory entities as JSON
* `/services/inventory/<itemId>` that is accessible via _HTTP GET_ at for example `services/inventory/329199` with the last path parameter
being the ID for which we want inventory status.

==== 6. Add inventory data

Let’s add inventory data to the database so we can test things out. Open up the `src/main/resources/import.sql` file and copy
the following SQL statements to *import.sql*:

[source,sql, role="copypaste"]
----
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '329299', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=Raleigh', 'Raleigh', 736);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '329199', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=Boston', 'Boston', 512);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '165613', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=Seoul', 'Seoul', 256);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '165614', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=Singapore', 'Singapore', 54);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '165954', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=London', 'London', 87);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '444434', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=NewYork', 'NewYork', 443);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '444435', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=Paris', 'Paris', 600);
INSERT INTO INVENTORY (id, itemId, link, location, quantity) values (nextval('hibernate_sequence'), '444437', 'http://maps.google.com/?q=Tokyo', 'Tokyo', 230);
----

In Development, we will configure to use local in-memory H2 database for local testing. Add these lines to
`src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source,properties,role="copypaste"]
----
%dev.quarkus.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:inventory
%dev.quarkus.datasource.driver=org.h2.Driver
%dev.quarkus.datasource.username=inventory
%dev.quarkus.datasource.password=mysecretpassword
%dev.quarkus.datasource.max-size=8
%dev.quarkus.datasource.min-size=2
%dev.quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create
%dev.quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.sql=false
----

==== 7. Run Quarkus Inventory application

In the Terminal, run the project in _Live Coding_ mode:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn quarkus:dev -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/inventory
----

You should see a bunch of log output that ends with:

[source,console]
----
2020-03-19 14:41:17,171 INFO  [io.agr.pool] (main) Datasource '<default>': Initial size smaller than min. Connections will be created when necessary
2020-03-19 14:41:17,454 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) inventory 1.0-SNAPSHOT (running on Quarkus xx.xx.xx) started in 3.353s. Listening on: http://0.0.0.0:8080
2020-03-19 14:41:17,457 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Profile dev activated. Live Coding activated.
2020-03-19 14:41:17,457 INFO  [io.quarkus] (main) Installed features: [agroal, cdi, hibernate-orm, hibernate-orm-panache, jdbc-h2, narayana-jta, resteasy, resteasy-jsonb, smallrye-health]
----

CodeReady will also detect that the Quarkus app opens port `5005` (for debugging) and `8080` (for web requests). Do not open port 5005, but when prompted, open the port `8080`, which opens a small web browser in CodeReady:

image::open-port.png[Inventory RESTful Service, 700]

You should see the inventory web frontend directly in CodeReady (you may need to click the _reload_ icon):

image::inventory-codeready.png[Inventory RESTful Service, 700]

Open a *new* CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

image::codeready-workspace-terminal.png[Inventory RESTful Service, 700]

and invoke the RESTful endpoint using the following CURL commands.

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/services/inventory | jq
----

The output looks like:

[source,json]
----
  ...
  {
    "id": 7,
    "itemId": "444435",
    "link": "http://maps.google.com/?q=Paris",
    "location": "Paris",
    "quantity": 600
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "itemId": "444437",
    "link": "http://maps.google.com/?q=Tokyo",
    "location": "Tokyo",
    "quantity": 230
  }
----

==== 8. Add health probe

===== What is MicroProfile Health?

*MicroProfile Health* allows applications to provide information about their state to external viewers which is typically useful
in cloud environments like OpenShift where automated processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded or
restarted.

===== Run the health check

When you imported the _health extension_ earlier, the `/health` endpoint is automatically exposed directly that can be used to
run the health check procedures.

Our application is still running, so you can exercise the default (no-op) health check with this command in a separate Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq
----

The output shows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Database connections health check",
      "status": "UP"
    }
  ]
}
----

The general _outcome_ of the health check is computed as a logical AND of all the declared health check procedures. Quarkus extensions can also provide default health checks out of the box, which is why you see the `Database connections health check` above, since we are using a database extension.

==== 9. Create your first health check

Next, let’s fill in the class by creating a new RESTful endpoint which will be used by OpenShift to probe our services. Open empty
Java class: `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/InventoryHealthCheck.java` and add the following code:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheck;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.HealthCheckResponse;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.health.Readiness;

@Readiness
@ApplicationScoped
public class InventoryHealthCheck implements HealthCheck {

    @Inject
    private InventoryResource inventoryResource;

    @Override
    public HealthCheckResponse call() {

        if (inventoryResource.getAll() != null) {
            return HealthCheckResponse.named("Success of Inventory Health Check!!!").up().build();
        } else {
            return HealthCheckResponse.named("Failure of Inventory Health Check!!!").down().build();
        }
    }
}
----

The `call()` method exposes an HTTP GET endpoint which will return the status of the service. The logic of this check does a
simple query to the underlying database to ensure the connection to it is stable and available. The method is also annotated with
MicroProfile's `@Readiness` annotation, which directs Quarkus to expose this endpoint as a health check at `/health/ready`.

[NOTE]
====
You don’t need to stop and re-run re-run the Inventory application because Quarkus will *reload the changes automatically* via the _Live Coding_ feature.
====

Access the health endpoint again using _curl_ and the result looks like:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health | jq
----

The result should be:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Success of Inventory Health Check!!!",
      "status": "UP"
    },
    {
      "name": "Database connections health check",
      "status": "UP"
    }
  ]
}
----

You now see the default health check, along with your new Inventory health check.

[NOTE]
====
You can define separate readiness and liveness probes using `@Liveness` and `@Readiness` annotations and access them separately at `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.
====

===== Cleanup

Stop the Quarkus app by typing kbd:[CTRL-C] in the Terminal in which the app runs.

==== 10. Create OpenShift Project

In this step, we will deploy our new Inventory microservice for our CoolStore application in a separate project to house
it and keep it separate from our monolith and our other microservices we will create later on.

Before going to OpenShift console, we will repackage the Quarkus application for adding a PostgreSQL extension because our
Inventory service will connect to PostgeSQL database in production on OpenShift.

Quarkus also offers the ability to automatically generate OpenShift resources based on sane default and user supplied configuration. The OpenShift extension is actually a wrapper extension that brings together the https://quarkus.io/guides/deploying-to-kubernetes[kubernetes^] and https://quarkus.io/guides/container-image#s2i[container-image-s2i^] extensions with defaults so that it’s easier for the user to get started with Quarkus on OpenShift.

Add _quarkus-jdbc-postgresql_ and _openshift_ extension via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
mvn -q quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="jdbc-postgresql,openshift" -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/inventory
----

you will see:

[source,sh]
----
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-openshift has been installed
✅ Extension io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql has been installed
----

Quarkus supports the notion of _configuration profiles_. These allows you to have multiple configurations in the same file and
select between then via a _profile name_.

By default Quarkus has three profiles, although it is possible to use as many as you like. The default profiles are:

* `dev` - Activated when in development mode (i.e. *quarkus:dev*)
* `test` - Activated when running tests
* `prod` - The default profile when not running in development or test mode

Let’s `add` the following variables in _src/main/resources/application.properties_:

[source,shell,role="copypaste"]
----
%prod.quarkus.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://inventory-database:5432/inventory
%prod.quarkus.datasource.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
%prod.quarkus.datasource.username=inventory
%prod.quarkus.datasource.password=mysecretpassword
%prod.quarkus.datasource.max-size=8
%prod.quarkus.datasource.min-size=2
%prod.quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create
%prod.quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script=import.sql
%prod.quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.sql=true
%prod.quarkus.s2i.base-jvm-image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-11

%prod.quarkus.kubernetes-client.trust-certs=true<1>
%prod.quarkus.container-image.build=true<2>
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true<3>
%prod.quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=openshift<4>
%prod.quarkus.openshift.expose=true<5>
%prod.quarkus.openshift.labels.app.openshift.io/runtime=quarkus<6>
----

<1> We are using self-signed certs in this simple example, so this simply says to the extension to trust them.
<2> Instructs the extension to build a container image
<3> Instructs the extension to deploy to OpenShift after the container image is built
<4> Instructs the extension to generate and create the OpenShift resources (like `DeploymentConfig` and `Service`) after building the container
<5> Instructs the extension to generate an OpenShift `Route`.
<6> Adds a nice-looking icon to the app when viewing the OpenShift Developer Toplogy

In OpenShift, ensure you're in the _Developer_ perspective and then choose the `{{ USER_ID }}-inventory` project which has already been created for you.

There’s nothing there yet, but that’s about to change.

==== 11. Deploy to OpenShift

Let’s deploy our new inventory microservice to OpenShift!

Our production inventory microservice will use an external database (PostgreSQL) to house inventory data. First, deploy a new
instance of PostgreSQL. Click **+Add** on the left, on the _Database_ box on the project overview:

image::db.png[db, 700]

Type in `postgres` in the search box, and click on the *PostgreSQL (ephemeral)*:

image::db-postgres.png[db, 700]

Click on *Instantiate Template* and fill in the following fields, leaving the others as their default values:

* **Namespace**: _choose `{{ USER_ID }}-inventory` for the first Namespace. Leave the second one as `openshift`_
* **Database Service Name**: `inventory-database`
* **PostgreSQL Connection Username**: `inventory`
* **PostgreSQL Connection Password**: `mysecretpassword`
* **PostgreSQL Database Name**: `inventory`

image::db-postgres-inventory-values.png[db, 700]

Click *Create*.

This will deploy the database to our new project. Click on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-inventory[Topology View^] to see it:

image::inventory-database-deployment.png[inventory_db_deployments, 700]

==== 12. Deploy to OpenShift

Now let's deploy the application itself. Run the following command which will build and deploy using the OpenShift extension:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc project {{ USER_ID }}-inventory && \
mvn clean package -DskipTests -f $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs/inventory
----

The output should end with `BUILD SUCCESS`.

Finally, make sure it's actually done rolling out:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc rollout status -w dc/inventory
----

Wait for that command to report *replication controller _inventory-1_ successfully rolled out* before continuing.

And label the items with proper icons:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc label dc/inventory-database app.openshift.io/runtime=postgresql --overwrite && \
oc label dc/inventory app.kubernetes.io/part-of=inventory --overwrite && \
oc label dc/inventory-database app.kubernetes.io/part-of=inventory --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/inventory app.openshift.io/connects-to=inventory-database --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/inventory app.openshift.io/vcs-uri=https://github.com/RedHat-Middleware-Workshops/cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs.git --overwrite && \
oc annotate dc/inventory app.openshift.io/vcs-ref=ocp-4.7 --overwrite
----

Back on the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-inventory[Topology View^], make sure it's done deploying (dark blue circle):

image::inventory-rollout.png[inventory_db_deployments, 700]

Click on the Route icon above (the arrow) to access our inventory running on OpenShift:

image::inventory-web.png[web, 700]

The UI will refresh the inventory table every 2 seconds.

You should also be able to access the health check logic at the _inventory_ endpoint using _curl_ in the Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
curl $(oc get route inventory -o jsonpath={% raw %}"{.spec.host}"{% endraw %})/health/ready | jq
----

You should the same JSON response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Database connections health check",
      "status": "UP"
    },
    {
      "name": "Success of Inventory Health Check!!!",
      "status": "UP"
    }
  ]
}
----

==== 13. Adjust probe timeout

The various timeout values for the probes can be configured in many ways. Let’s tune the _readiness probe_ initial delay so that
we have to wait 30 seconds for it to be activated. Use the _oc_ command to tune the probe to wait 30 seconds before starting to
poll the probe:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc set probe dc/inventory --readiness --initial-delay-seconds=30
----

And verify it’s been changed (look at the _delay=_ value for the Readiness probe) via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc describe dc/inventory | egrep 'Readiness|Liveness'
----

The result:

[source,console]
----
    Readiness:          http-get http://:8080/health/ready delay=30s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 #failure=3
----

In the next step, we’ll exercise the probe and watch as it fails and OpenShift recovers the application.

==== 14. Exercise Health Check

Open the http://inventory-{{ USER_ID }}-inventory.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN}}[Inventory UI^].

This will open up the sample application UI in a new browser tab:

image::app.png[App UI, 700]

The app will begin polling the inventory as before and report success:

image::inventory.png[Greeting, 700]

Now you will corrupt the service and cause its health check to start failing. To simulate the app crashing, let’s kill the
underlying service so it stops responding. Execute via CodeReady Workspaces Terminal:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc rsh dc/inventory kill 1
----

This will execute the Linux *pkill* command to stop the running Java process in the container.

Check out the application sample UI page and notice it is now failing to access the inventory data, and the _Last Successful
Fetch_ counter starts increasing, indicating that the UI cannot access inventory. This could have been caused by an overloaded
server, a bug in the code, or any other reason that could make the application unhealthy.

image::inventory-fail.png[Greeting, 700]

Back in the {{ CONSOLE_URL }}/topology/ns/{{ USER_ID }}-inventory[Topology View^], you will see the pod is failing (light blue or yellow warning circle):

image::notready.png[Not Ready, 700]

After too many healthcheck probe failures, OpenShift will forcibly kill the pod and container running the service, and spin up a
new one to take its place. Once this occurs, the light blue or yellow warning circle should return to dark blue. This should take about 30 seconds.

Return to the same sample app UI (without reloading the page) and notice that the UI has automatically re-connected to the new
service and successfully accessed the inventory once again:

image::inventory.png[Greeting, 700]

Let's set the probe back to more appropriate values:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
oc set probe dc/inventory --readiness --initial-delay-seconds=5 --period-seconds=5 --failure-threshold=15
----

=== Summary

You learned a bit more about what Quarkus is, and how it can be used to create modern Java microservice-oriented applications.

You created a new Inventory microservice representing functionality previously implmented in the monolithic CoolStore application.
For now this new microservice is completely disconnected from our monolith and is not very useful on its own. In future steps you will link this and other microservices into the monolith to begin the process of
https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html[strangling the monolith^].

In the next lab, you’ll use Spring Boot, another popular framework, to implement additional microservices. Let’s go!
