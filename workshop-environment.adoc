Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----
