The environment you are using is one of a set of applications useful in hosting training workshops. These can be supervised workshops run in a classroom like environment, or can be self paced workshops provided via an online interactive learning portal.

In this workshop you will learn how to create and structure the content for a workshop. You will also learn how to deploy your workshop content to be able to test it.

For your own workshop, this initial home page is where you would provide a description of what your workshop is about.
