This half day hands-on cloud-native workshops(`module 1`) provides developers and introduction to cloud-natives applications and gives them an experience of building cloud-native applications using Red Hat Application Rumties(i.e. Throntail, Spring Boot) with OpenShift and more.

* Decide which Application Server to use in OpenShift
* Migrate your application to JBoss EAP
* Breaking the monolith apart - I
* Breaking the monolith apart - II

Lab Instructions on OpenShift

Note that if you have installed the lab infra via APB, the lab instructions are already deployed.

Here is an example Ansible playbook to deploy the lab instruction to your OpenShift cluster manually.
