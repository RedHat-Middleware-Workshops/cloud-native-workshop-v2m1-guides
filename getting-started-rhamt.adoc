= Getting Started with Application Migration
:experimental:

In this module you’ll work with an existing Java EE application designed for a retail webshop.  The current
version of the webshop is a Java EE application built for Oracle Weblogic Application Server. As part of a modernization
strategy you've decided to move this application to JBoss EAP, containerize it, and run it on a Kubernetes platform with OpenShift.

=== What is Migration Toolkit for Applications?

image::rhamt_logo.png[MTA Logo, 500]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) is an extensible and customizable rule-based tool that helps simplify migration of
Java applications.

It is used by organizations for:

* Planning and work estimation
* Identifying migration issues and providing solutions
* Detailed reporting
* Built-in rules and migration paths
* Rule extensibility and customization
* Ability to analyze source code or application archives

Read more about it in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[MTA documentation^]

== Lab 1 - Login to MTA and analyze app

In this step we will analyze a monolithic application built for use with Oracle® WebLogic Server (WLS). This application is a Java
EE application using a number of different technologies, including standard Java EE APIs as well as proprietary Weblogic APIs and
best practices.

For this lab, we will use the MTA Web Console on top of OpenShift Container Platform.

=== 1. Login to the MTA web console in OpenShift cluster

To get started, {{ MTA_URL }}[access the Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit^] and log in
using the username and password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

=== 2. Create a new project

Click **New Project**. Input a name and optional description to create a project. Name the project `{{USER_ID}}-eap-migration` to avoid conflicts with other attendees.

=== 3. Add the monolith application to the project

Select *Server Path* to analyze our monolithic application:

* Server Path: `/opt/apps`

=== 4. Select _Migration to JBoss EAP 7_ in Transformation Path

Choose the `com` and `weblogic` checkboxes to include these packages during analysis and click the *Save & Run* button. You
will be taken to Analysis Results dashboard page, wait until the analysis is complete (it will take a minute or two).

=== 5. Go to the Active Analysis page and click on the latest when it’s completed

[NOTE]
====
Your report may be _queued_ for a few seconds. Soon you will see a progress bar, then when the report is complete you can continue. If it seems to be queued for more than a minute, try refreshing the browser page.
====

Click the `#1` link (or `#2`) to see the report:

=== 6. Review the report

image::rhamt_result_landing_page.png[MTA Langing Page, 900]

The main landing page of the report lists the applications that were processed. Each row contains a high-level overview of the
story points, number of incidents, and technologies encountered in that application.

**Click on the `monolith.war` link** to access details for the project:

=== 7. Understanding the report

The Dashboard gives an overview of the entire application migration effort. It summarizes:

* The incidents and story points by category
* The incidents and story points by level of effort of the suggested changes
* The incidents by package

[NOTE]
====
Story points are an abstract metric commonly used in Agile software development to estimate the relative level of effort needed to
implement a feature or change. Red Hat Application Migration Toolkit uses story points to express the level of effort needed to
migrate particular application constructs, and the application as a whole. The level of effort will vary greatly depending on the
size and complexity of the application(s) to migrate.
====

You can use this report to estimate how easy/hard each app is, and make decisions about which apps to migrate, which to refactor, and which to leave alone. In this case we will do a straight migration to JBoss EAP.

On to the next step to change the code!
